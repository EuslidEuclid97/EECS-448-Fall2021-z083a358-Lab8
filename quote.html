            She should have died hereafter.<br>
            There would have been a time for such a word.<br>
            Tomorrow, and tomorrow, and tomorrow,<br>
            Creeps in this petty pace from day to day<br>
            To the last syllable of recorded time,<br>
            And all our yesterdays have lighted fools<br>
            The way to dusty death. Out, out, brief candle!<br>
            Lifeâ€™s but a walking shadow, a poor player<br>
            That struts and frets his hour upon the stage<br>
            And then is heard no more. It is a tale<br>
            Told by an idiot, full of sound and fury,<br>
            Signifying nothing. <br>
            -From Macbeth, Act V, Scene V by William Shakespeare
